This directory contains a new version of "makemake". It is derived
from the version by Ken Reek but updated to use the Standard Template
Library. The intention is to release the source code to students as an
example of C++ code.

Some changes in this version:

Support for SGI machines has been eliminated.

There is only one version - the program checks the first character of
the root name of the executable for 'g' and, if so, produces a
makefile for the gnu compiler. Otherwise it produces a makefile for
the sun compiler. The executables for makemake and gmakemake are
identical.

The current version produces makefiles that do not use default rules
or variables. Everything is explicit in the makefile. This will
eliminate the problem of using make (rather than gmake) on a gnu
compilation and not having debugging symbols. The produced makefiles
should work identically with make or gmake.

The -lm loader flag is not emitted for C++ links. It is for C links.

A file header.mak will still replace some lines in the makefile with
the contents of the this file.

A file programs.mak will replace the automatically generated
dependencies for executables so you can specify which files to link
and what the name of the executable is. If you do not use this option
then an executable will be built for each source file containing a
main function including every .o file without a main function.

Not done yet (or ever):

check include files -I and properly put path in dependencies

Currently .o files without a corresponding source file do not
work. What about .o files without a corresponding .c or .cpp file?
(check for main?)
